Welcome the user to the address book     
The address book will then ask the user to input 1 or 2 to select if they want to add or search for a file on the database
If the user inputs 1 they will be able to create an entry
It will ask them to make an address based of their:
First name
Last name
Telephone
Email 
Address
Once this process is done it will add it to the address book to be search for at a later date
If the user inputs 2 then it will take them to the search engine
It will give the user a list of searching options
The user will input any information about the person and the computer will find anyone in the address book with that information
It will then print to the user all of the people with that information
If there is no valid search, the program will end
The program will then end
